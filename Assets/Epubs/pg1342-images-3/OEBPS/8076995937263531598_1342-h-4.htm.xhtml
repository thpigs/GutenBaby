<p>“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with
who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without
him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at
Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for
laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my
engagement, and dancing with him to-night.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{357}" id="pgepubid00394"><a id="page_357" title="{357}"></a></span> Tell him I hope he will
excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at
the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my
clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to
mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.</p>

“Your affectionate friend,<br/>
<br/>
“<span class="smcap">Lydia Bennet</span>.”<br/>
</p></div>

<p>“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But
at least it shows that <i>she</i> was serious in the object of her journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
<i>scheme</i> of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”</p>

<p>“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”</p>

<p>“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much
as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.”</p>

<p>“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”</p>

<p>“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{358}" id="pgepubid00395"><a id="page_358" title="{358}"></a></span> right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of
repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on
Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady
Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us.”</p>

<p>“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she
<i>meant</i> well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.</p>

<p>“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{359}" id="pgepubid00396"><a id="page_359" title="{359}"></a></span>”</p>

<img alt="T" src="8773024604044034626_i_388_b.png" id="img_images_i_388_b.png"/></span>HE whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of <i>that</i> they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.</p>

<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{360}" id="pgepubid00398"><a id="page_360" title="{360}"></a></span> receiving constant
information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.</p>

<p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{361}" id="pgepubid00399"><a id="page_361" title="{361}"></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and
promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect:—</p>

<p>“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there
were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.</p>

<p>She had never heard of his having had any relations,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{362}" id="pgepubid00400"><a id="page_362" title="{362}"></a></span> except a father
and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,
however, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to
give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>

<p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.</p>

<p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="nind">“My dear Sir,</p>

<p>“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and
myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{363}" id="pgepubid00401"><a id="page_363" title="{363}"></a></span> The
death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness

<p class="nind">daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,
at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,
I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied;<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{364}" id="pgepubid00402"><a id="page_364" title="{364}"></a></span> in
which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by
Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one
daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,
moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been
involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,
my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.</p>

<p>
“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.<br/>
</p></div>

<p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His
former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{365}" id="pgepubid00403"><a id="page_365" title="{365}"></a></span> in the
town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner
did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;
Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly
unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.</p>

<p>“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.</p>

<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{366}" id="pgepubid00404"><a id="page_366" title="{366}"></a></span> other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from <i>that</i>,—though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.</p>

<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.”</p>

<p>“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose them to be in London?”</p>

<p>“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”</p>

<p>“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.</p>

<p>“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{367}" id="pgepubid00405"><a id="page_367" title="{367}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”</p>

<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
tea.</p>

<p>“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can,—or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If <i>I</i>
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.”</p>

<p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{368}" id="pgepubid00406"><a id="page_368" title="{368}"></a></span>”</p>

<img alt="T" src="8773024604044034626_i_397_b.png" id="img_images_i_397_b.png"/></span>WO days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”</p>

<p>“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{369}" id="pgepubid00408"><a id="page_369" title="{369}"></a></span> from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.”</p>

<p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library;—their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,—</p>

<p>“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the
little copse.”</p>

<p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</p>

<p>Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,—</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”</p>

<p>“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.</p>

<p>“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
about.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">“Gracechurch Street, <i>Monday, August 2</i>.</p>

<p class="nind">
“My dear Brother,<br/>

as, upon the whole, I hope will give<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{370}" id="pgepubid00409"><a id="page_370" title="{370}"></a></span> you satisfaction. Soon after
you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what
part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.
It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them
both——”</p>

<p>“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{371}" id="pgepubid00410"><a id="page_371" title="{371}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,
nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on
your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,
considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as
far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will
immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper
settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on
my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,
and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my
niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
possible that he will marry her?”</p>

<p>“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her
sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“No; but it must be done soon.”</p>

<p>Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”</p>

<p>“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”</p>

<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</p>

<p>“And—may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.”</p>

<p>“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”</p>

<p>“And they <i>must</i> marry! Yet he is <i>such</i> a man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know:—one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever
to pay him.”</p>

<p>“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{373}" id="pgepubid00412"><a id="page_373" title="{373}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,
it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”</p>

<p>“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?”</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for <i>this</i> we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”</p>

<p>“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would
not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”</p>

<p>“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said
Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited. Their taking her home, and affording<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{374}" id="pgepubid00413"><a id="page_374" title="{374}"></a></span> her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!”</p>

<p>“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”</p>

<p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
replied,—</p>

<p>“Just as you please.”</p>

<p>“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”</p>

<p>“Take whatever you like, and get away.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{375}" id="pgepubid00414"><a id="page_375" title="{375}"></a></span> was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My
good, kind brother! I knew how it would be—I knew he would manage
everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”</p>

<p>Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.</p>

<p>“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.”</p>

<p>“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{376}" id="pgepubid00415"><a id="page_376" title="{376}"></a></span> am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you
write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”</p>

<p>She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.</p>

<p>“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An
airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s
situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she
had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{377}" id="pgepubid00416"><a id="page_377" title="{377}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER L.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="M" src="8773024604044034626_i_406_b.png" id="img_images_i_406_b.png"/></span>R. BENNET had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{378}"><a id="page_378" title="{378}"></a></span> men in Great Britain to
be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.</p>

<p>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.</p>

<p>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her
husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.</p>

<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{379}" id="pgepubid00418"><a id="page_379" title="{379}"></a></span>
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within
that sum.</p>

<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.</p>

<p>The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery
was considered certain.</p>

<p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{380}" id="pgepubid00419"><a id="page_380" title="{380}"></a></span> The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.</p>

<p>“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”</p>

<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into <i>one</i> house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”</p>

<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{381}" id="pgepubid00420"><a id="page_381" title="{381}"></a></span> disgrace, which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.</p>

<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s
frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.</p>

<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{382}" id="pgepubid00421"><a id="page_382" title="{382}"></a></span> that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.</p>

<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.</p>

<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.</p>

<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.</p>

<p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{383}" id="pgepubid00422"><a id="page_383" title="{383}"></a></span> The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.</p>

<p>“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his
marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the
Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General——’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is
an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.—Yours, etc.</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">E. Gardiner</span>.”<br/>
</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{384}" id="pgepubid00423"><a id="page_384" title="{384}"></a></span>of Wickham’s
removal from the ——shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in
the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p>

<p>“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General——’s
regiment.”</p>

<p>His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{385}" id="pgepubid00424"><a id="page_385" title="{385}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LI.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="T" src="8773024604044034626_i_414_b.png" id="img_images_i_414_b.png"/></span>HEIR sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
them at——, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival
was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets—and Jane more<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{386}"><a id="page_386" title="{386}"></a></span> especially, who
gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had <i>she</i>
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.</p>

<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.</p>

<p>Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.</p>

<p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was
Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
great while since she had been there.</p>

<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{387}" id="pgepubid00426"><a id="page_387" title="{387}"></a></span>
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the
impudence of an impudent man. <i>She</i> blushed, and Jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.</p>

<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.</p>

<p>“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:
it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.”</p>

<p>Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,—</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was
afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,
so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass
next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame, so that he<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{388}" id="pgepubid00427"><a id="page_388" title="{388}"></a></span> might see the ring, and then I bowed and
smiled like anything.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister,—</p>

<p>“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a
married woman.”</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by
each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p>

<p>“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they
may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the
place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”</p>

<p>“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at
Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I
will take care to get good partners for them all.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{389}" id="pgepubid00428"><a id="page_389" title="{389}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.</p>

<p>“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.”</p>

<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>

<p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not.</p>

<p>Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.</p>

<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did
everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{390}" id="pgepubid00429"><a id="page_390" title="{390}"></a></span> birds
on the first of September than anybody else in the country.</p>

<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,—</p>

<p>“Lizzy, I never gave <i>you</i> an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”</p>

<p>“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little
said on the subject.”</p>

<p>“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.</p>

<p>“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should
have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was
dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether
he would be married in his blue coat.</p>

<p>“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{391}" id="pgepubid00430"><a id="page_391" title="{391}"></a></span></p>

<p>“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you
know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so
frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;
and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set
out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he <i>had</i> been prevented
going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as
well.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”</p>

<p>“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”</p>

<p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.</p>

<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{392}" id="pgepubid00431"><a id="page_392" title="{392}"></a></span> hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.</p>

<p>“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.”</p>

<p>“Not that I <i>shall</i>, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the
letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.”</p>

<p>Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
it:—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{393}" id="pgepubid00432"><a id="page_393" title="{393}"></a></span></p>

soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{394}"><a id="page_394" title="{394}"></a></span> to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">“Gracechurch Street, <i>Sept. 6</i>.</p>

<p class="nind">
“My dear Niece,<br/>
</p>

<p>“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
morning to answering it, as I foresee that a <i>little</i> writing will
not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
surprised by your application; I did not expect it from <i>you</i>.
Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on <i>your</i>
side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing
but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and
ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming
home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.
Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all
over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
as <i>yours</i> seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he
had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he
had seen and talked with them both—Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after
ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as
to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to
lay his private actions open to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{395}" id="pgepubid00434"><a id="page_395" title="{395}"></a></span> the world. His character was to
speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step
forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
by himself. If he <i>had another</i> motive, I am sure it would never
disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to
discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
more than <i>we</i> had; and the consciousness of this was another
reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,
and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he
went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our
kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ——
Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none
of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of
leaving Wickham.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{396}" id="pgepubid00435"><a id="page_396" title="{396}"></a></span> She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her
feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he
easily learnt had never been <i>his</i> design. He confessed himself
obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to
resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but
he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live
on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,
that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such
circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there
was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he
could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything
being settled between <i>them</i>, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make
your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not
be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did
not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly
consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
till after the <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{397}" id="pgepubid00436"><a id="page_397" title="{397}"></a></span>departure of the former. He did not leave his name,
and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called
on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your
uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
together. They met again on Sunday, and then <i>I</i> saw him too. It
was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express
was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I
fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;
but <i>this</i> is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not
do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,
therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have
settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which
was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning
gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or
Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done
for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I
believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another
thousand in addition to her own settled upon <i>her</i>, and his
commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him
alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character
had been so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{398}" id="pgepubid00437"><a id="page_398" title="{398}"></a></span> misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
<i>this</i>; though I doubt whether <i>his</i> reserve, or <i>anybody’s</i>
reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this
fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
for <i>another interest</i> in the affair. When all this was resolved
on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more
when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to
us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. <i>He</i> was
exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
would not tell you how little I was satisfied with <i>her</i> behaviour
while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter
last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it
was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes
quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,
and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual
in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He
dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{399}" id="pgepubid00438"><a id="page_399" title="{399}"></a></span>
Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
a little more liveliness, and <i>that</i>, if he marry <i>prudently</i>, his
wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever
mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive
me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I
have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair
of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The
children have been wanting me this half hour.</p>

<p class="r">
“Yours, very sincerely,<br/>
“<span class="smcap">M. Gardiner</span>.”<br/>
</p></div>

<p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her
sister’s match—which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
just, from the pain of obligation—were proved beyond their greatest
extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken
on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he
must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently
meet, reason with, persuade, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{400}" id="pgepubid00439"><a id="page_400" title="{400}"></a></span> finally bribe the man whom he always
most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard
nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it
was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from
the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think
how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to
him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,—proud that
in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better
of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and
again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible
of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{401}"><a id="page_401" title="{401}"></a></span> finding how steadfastly
both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>

<p>She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;
and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
Wickham.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he joined her.</p>

<p>“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. <i>We</i> were always good friends,
and now we are better.”</p>

<p>“True. Are the others coming out?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.”</p>

<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p>“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned
out well. At such a distance as <i>that</i>, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{402}" id="pgepubid00440"><a id="page_402" title="{402}"></a></span>—</p>

<p>“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”</p>

<p>“And do you like her?”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”</p>

<p>“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”</p>

<p>“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”</p>

<p>“I do not recollect that we did.”</p>

<p>“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most
delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in
every respect.”</p>

<p>“How should you have liked making sermons?”</p>

<p>“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,
to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the
retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of
happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in Kent?”</p>

<p>“I <i>have</i> heard from authority, which I thought <i>as good</i>,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{403}" id="pgepubid00441"><a id="page_403" title="{403}"></a></span> that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”</p>

<p>“You have! Yes, there was something in <i>that</i>; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.”</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”</p>

<p>“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”</p>

<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,—</p>

<p>“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{404}" id="pgepubid00442"><a id="page_404" title="{404}"></a></span></p>

<img alt="M" src="8773024604044034626_i_433_b.png" id="img_images_i_433_b.png"/></span>R. WICKHAM was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{405}"><a id="page_405" title="{405}"></a></span></p>

<p>The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Write to me very often, my dear.”</p>

<p>“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to <i>me</i>. They will have nothing else to
do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.</p>

<p>“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”</p>

<p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.</p>

<p>“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”</p>

<p>“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.”</p>

<p>“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{406}" id="pgepubid00444"><a id="page_406" title="{406}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled, and shook her head, by turns.</p>

<p>“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that
I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I
never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what <i>may</i> happen? But that
is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”</p>

<p>“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in
Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He
comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”</p>

<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,—</p>

<p>“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{407}" id="pgepubid00445"><a id="page_407" title="{407}"></a></span> distressed; but don’t imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I <i>should</i> be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
<i>myself</i>, but I dread other people’s remarks.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there <i>with</i> his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.</p>

<p>“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I <i>will</i> leave him to himself.”</p>

<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.</p>

<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.</p>

<p>“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”</p>

<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{408}" id="pgepubid00446"><a id="page_408" title="{408}"></a></span> such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis an <i>etiquette</i> I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend <i>my</i> hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.”</p>

<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
<i>they</i> did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—</p>

<p>“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days
that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{409}" id="pgepubid00447"><a id="page_409" title="{409}"></a></span> must intervene before their invitation could be sent—hopeless of
seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in
Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.</p>

<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window—she looked—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.</p>

<p>“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”</p>

<p>“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”</p>

<p>“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what’s his name—that tall, proud man.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.”</p>

<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.
Gardine<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{410}" id="pgepubid00448"><a id="page_410" title="{410}"></a></span>r’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.</p>

<p>“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”</p>

<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.</p>

<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual;<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{411}" id="pgepubid00449"><a id="page_411" title="{411}"></a></span> and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her
mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a
painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.</p>

<p>Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her courtesy and address of his friend.</p>

<p>Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.</p>

<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did—a question
which she could not answer without confusion—said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.</p>

<p>“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{412}" id="pgepubid00450"><a id="page_412" title="{412}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>

<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>

<p>“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.</p>

<p>He readily agreed to it.</p>

<p>“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People <i>did</i> say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,
George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”</p>

<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.</p>

<p>“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not
know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of
his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.
Thank heaven!<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{413}" id="pgepubid00451"><a id="page_413" title="{413}"></a></span> he has <i>some</i> friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</p>

<p>“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.</p>

<p>“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be
in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!”</p>

<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her
as handsome as she had<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{414}" id="pgepubid00452"><a id="page_414" title="{414}"></a></span> been last year; as good-natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.</p>

<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days’ time.</p>

<p>“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you
I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
engagement.”</p>

<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{415}" id="pgepubid00453"><a id="page_415" title="{415}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LIV.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="A" src="8773024604044034626_i_444_b.png" id="img_images_i_444_b.png"/></span>S soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.</p>

<p>“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
“did he come at all?”</p>

<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>

<p>“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{416}" id="pgepubid00455"><a id="page_416" title="{416}"></a></span> If he fears me, why come hither? If he
no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think
no more about him.”</p>

<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!
take care.”</p>

<p>“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”</p>

<p>“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”</p>

<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
had revived.</p>

<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{417}" id="pgepubid00456"><a id="page_417" title="{417}"></a></span> seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.</p>

<p>His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.</p>

<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{418}" id="pgepubid00457"><a id="page_418" title="{418}"></a></span> to enter into something more of conversation,
than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.</p>

<p>“If he does not come to me, <i>then</i>,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,—</p>

<p>“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?”</p>

<p>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!</p>

<p>“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”</p>

<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{419}" id="pgepubid00458"><a id="page_419" title="{419}"></a></span>—</p>

<p>“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”</p>

<p>“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough
these three weeks.”</p>

<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.</p>

<p>When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</p>

<p>“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I
assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{420}" id="pgepubid00459"><a id="page_420" title="{420}"></a></span> remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as
good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved
girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption31">
<img alt="" src="8773024604044034626_i_449.jpg" id="img_images_i_449.jpg"/>

<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.</p>

<p>“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>

<p>“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”</p>

<p>“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.”</p>

<p>“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in
others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?”</p>

<p>“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make <i>me</i> your
confidante.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{422}" id="pgepubid00461"><a id="page_422" title="{422}"></a></span>”</p>

<img alt="A" src="8773024604044034626_i_451_b.png" id="img_images_i_451_b.png"/></span> FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{423}"><a id="page_423" title="{423}"></a></span> in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”</p>

<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.</p>

<p>“Can you come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.</p>

<p>He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her
dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,—</p>

<p>“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy’s hair.”</p>

<p>“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!
where is your sash, my dear?”</p>

<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.</p>

<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{424}" id="pgepubid00463"><a id="page_424" title="{424}"></a></span> making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,—</p>

<p>“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
premeditation, and her entreaty that <i>she</i> would not give in to it. In a
few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,—</p>

<p>“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was forced to go.</p>

<p>“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
daughter.</p>

<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away
an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s
means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{425}" id="pgepubid00464"><a id="page_425" title="{425}"></a></span></p>

<p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the
happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
concurrence.</p>

<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to
write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.</p>

<p>But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. <i>Their</i> situation was awkward enough; but
<i>hers</i> she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by
either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
Bingley, who as well as the other had sat<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{426}" id="pgepubid00465"><a id="page_426" title="{426}"></a></span> down, suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>

<p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,
why is not everybody as happy?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.</p>

<p>“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”</p>

<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>

<p>“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”</p>

<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{427}" id="pgepubid00466"><a id="page_427" title="{427}"></a></span> conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.</p>

<p>“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.</p>

<p>“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”</p>

<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.</p>

<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.</p>

<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,—</p>

<p>“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{428}" id="pgepubid00467"><a id="page_428" title="{428}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.</p>

<p>“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.”</p>

<p>“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!”</p>

<p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>

<p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</p>

<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{429}" id="pgepubid00468"><a id="page_429" title="{429}"></a></span> barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>

<p>“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.”</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for
it?”</p>

<p>“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once were to each other.”</p>

<p>“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”</p>

<p>“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of <i>my</i> being indifferent
would have prevented his coming down again?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{430}" id="pgepubid00469"><a id="page_430" title="{430}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.”</p>

<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.</p>

<p>“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such
another man for you!”</p>

<p>“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”</p>

<p>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.</p>

<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{431}" id="pgepubid00470"><a id="page_431" title="{431}"></a></span></p>

CHAPTER LVI.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img alt="O" src="8773024604044034626_i_460_b.png" id="img_images_i_460_b.png"/></span>NE morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{432}"><a id="page_432" title="{432}"></a></span> it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</p>

<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.</p>

<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,—</p>

<p>“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.</p>

<p>“And <i>that</i>, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.
“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{433}" id="pgepubid00472"><a id="page_433" title="{433}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a
short silence.</p>

<p>“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I
assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”</p>

<p>“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
summer: the windows are full west.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,—</p>

<p>“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some
refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,—</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.”</p>

<p>“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent-looking rooms, walked on.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{434}" id="pgepubid00473"><a id="page_434" title="{434}"></a></span></p>

<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.</p>

<p>“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:—</p>

<p>“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere <i>you</i> may
choose to be, you shall not find <i>me</i> so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
<i>you</i>—that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew—my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
<i>know</i> it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.”</p>

<p>“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”</p>

<p>“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{436}" id="pgepubid00475"><a id="page_436" title="{436}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it—if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”</p>

<p>“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?”</p>

<p>“I never heard that it was.”</p>

<p>“And can you likewise declare, that there is no <i>foundation</i> for it?”</p>

<p>“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. <i>You</i>
may ask questions which <i>I</i> shall not choose to answer.”</p>

<p>“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”</p>

<p>“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But <i>your</i> arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.”</p>

<p>“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”</p>

<p>“But you are not entitled to know <i>mine</i>; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.”</p>

<p>“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to <i>my daughter</i>. Now, what have you to say?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{437}" id="pgepubid00476"><a id="page_437" title="{437}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Only this,—that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”</p>

<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,—</p>

<p>“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
<i>his</i> mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends—to his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”</p>

<p>“Because honour, decorum, prudence—nay, interest—forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{438}" id="pgepubid00477"><a id="page_438" title="{438}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”</p>

<p>“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I
be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?—the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall
not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”</p>

<p>“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
equal.”</p>

<p>“True. You <i>are</i> a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{439}" id="pgepubid00478"><a id="page_439" title="{439}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”</p>

<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,—</p>

<p>“I am not.”</p>

<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>

<p>“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”</p>

<p>“I will make no promise of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.”</p>

<p>“And I certainly <i>never</i> shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
<i>their</i> marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
me, would <i>my</i> refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in <i>his</i> affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
subject.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{440}" id="pgepubid00479"><a id="page_440" title="{440}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is
<i>such</i> a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is <i>her</i> husband, who is the son
of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of
what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”</p>

<p>“You can <i>now</i> have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.”</p>

<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.</p>

<p>“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”</p>

<p>“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”</p>

<p>“You are then resolved to have him?”</p>

<p>“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to <i>you</i>, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”</p>

<p>“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”</p>

<p>“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{441}" id="pgepubid00480"><a id="page_441" title="{441}"></a></span> marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
<i>were</i> excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s
concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.”</p>

<p>“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”</p>

<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,—</p>

<p>“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>

<p>“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”</p>

<p>“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{442}" id="pgepubid00481"><a id="page_442" title="{442}"></a></span></p>

Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that <i>his</i> being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and <i>her</i> being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{443}" id="pgepubid00483"><a id="page_443" title="{443}"></a></span> communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had
only set <i>that</i> down as almost certain and immediate which <i>she</i> had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>

<p>In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an
application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than <i>she</i> could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with <i>one</i>
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>

<p>If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>

<p>“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{444}" id="pgepubid00484"><a id="page_444" title="{444}"></a></span> over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”</p>

<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>

<p>The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”</p>

<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.</p>

<p>She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He
then said,—</p>

<p>“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before that I had <i>two</i> daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”</p>

<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself, when her father continued,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{445}" id="pgepubid00485"><a id="page_445" title="{445}"></a></span>—</p>

<p>“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even <i>your</i> sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”</p>

<p>“From Mr. Collins! and what can <i>he</i> have to say?”</p>

<p>“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:—‘Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?
‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn
my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,
Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for
cautioning you is as follows:—We have reason to imagine that his aunt,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly
eye.’ <i>Mr. Darcy</i>, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{446}" id="pgepubid00486"><a id="page_446" title="{446}"></a></span> I <i>have</i>
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at <i>you</i> in
his life! It is admirable!”</p>

<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.</p>

<p>“Are you not diverted?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my
duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.
Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as
a Christian, but never to admit them<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{447}"><a id="page_447" title="{447}"></a></span> in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ <i>That</i> is his notion of
Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear
Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,
Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be
<i>missish</i>, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For
what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so
strange!”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>that</i> is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but <i>his</i> perfect indifference and <i>your</i>
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”</p>

<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too <i>little</i>, she might have fancied too <i>much</i>.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{448}" id="pgepubid00487"><a id="page_448" title="{448}"></a></span></p>

<img alt="I" src="8773024604044034626_i_477_b.png" id="img_images_i_477_b.png"/></span>NSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s
visit. The gentlemen<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{449}"><a id="page_449" title="{449}"></a></span> arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.</p>

<p>They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
high, she immediately said,—</p>

<p>“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{450}" id="pgepubid00489"><a id="page_450" title="{450}"></a></span> first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”</p>

<p>“If you <i>will</i> thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
<i>family</i> owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. <i>My</i>
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{451}" id="pgepubid00490"><a id="page_451" title="{451}"></a></span> feelings
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
every moment more valuable.</p>

<p>They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who <i>did</i> call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which <i>she</i> had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>

<p>“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of
my <i>frankness</i> to believe me capable of <i>that</i>. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.”</p>

<p>“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”</p>

<p>“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{452}" id="pgepubid00491"><a id="page_452" title="{452}"></a></span> of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,
improved in civility.”</p>

<p>“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I
confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”</p>

<p>“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”</p>

<p>“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,—“did it <i>soon</i> make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”</p>

<p>She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices had been removed.</p>

<p>“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,
especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power
of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{453}" id="pgepubid00492"><a id="page_453" title="{453}"></a></span> reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly
make you hate me.”</p>

<p>“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.”</p>

<p>“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”</p>

<p>“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my
philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. <i>Your</i>
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
ignorance. But with <i>me</i>, it is not so. Painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was <i>right</i>, but I was not taught to correct my
temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only <i>child</i>),
I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{454}" id="pgepubid00493"><a id="page_454" title="{454}"></a></span> own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
<i>wish</i> at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”</p>

<p>“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”</p>

<p>“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after <i>that</i> evening!”</p>

<p>“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
take a proper direction.”</p>

<p>“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”</p>

<p>“Your surprise could not be greater than <i>mine</i> in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive <i>more</i> than my due.”</p>

<p>“My object <i>then</i>,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves, I can hardly<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{455}" id="pgepubid00494"><a id="page_455" title="{455}"></a></span> tell, but I believe in about half
an hour after I had seen you.”</p>

<p>He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.</p>

<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.</p>

<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.</p>

<p>“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of <i>their</i> affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.</p>

<p>“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.</p>

<p>“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{456}" id="pgepubid00495"><a id="page_456" title="{456}"></a></span> believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.</p>

<p>“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”</p>

<p>“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”</p>

<p>“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”</p>

<p>“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one
thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of
Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{457}" id="pgepubid00496"><a id="page_457" title="{457}"></a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
“<img alt="M" src="8773024604044034626_i_486_b.png" id="img_images_i_486_b.png"/></span>Y dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{458}"><a id="page_458" title="{458}"></a></span> they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather <i>knew</i> that she was happy
than <i>felt</i> herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
<i>dislike</i> which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>

<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.</p>

<p>“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”</p>

<p>“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;
and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I
am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we
are engaged.”</p>

<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing of the matter. <i>That</i> is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{459}" id="pgepubid00498"><a id="page_459" title="{459}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously, assured her of its truth.</p>

<p>“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried
Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you
certain—forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we
are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?
Shall you like to have such a brother?”</p>

<p>“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel <i>more</i> than I ought to do when I
tell you all.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.”</p>

<p>“My dearest sister, now be, <i>be</i> serious. I want to talk very seriously.
Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”</p>

<p>“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;
but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”</p>

<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{460}" id="pgepubid00499"><a id="page_460" title="{460}"></a></span></p>

<p>“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I
must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s
way.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.</p>

<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”</p>

<p>“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{461}" id="pgepubid00500"><a id="page_461" title="{461}"></a></span> Bennet, “to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.”</p>

<p>“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”</p>

<p>Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,
saying,—</p>

<p>“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is
all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”</p>

<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.</p>

<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that <i>she</i>,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{462}" id="pgepubid00501"><a id="page_462" title="{462}"></a></span> disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he
wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.</p>

<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”</p>

<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?”</p>

<p>“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”</p>

<p>“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”</p>

<p>“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.”</p>

<p>“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{463}" id="pgepubid00502"><a id="page_463" title="{463}"></a></span> should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to <i>you</i>, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
<i>you</i> unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”</p>

<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.</p>

<p>“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and <i>would</i> have
paid him; but these violent<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{464}" id="pgepubid00503"><a id="page_464" title="{464}"></a></span> young lovers carry everything their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”</p>

<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.</p>

<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so
pleased—so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my
dear<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{465}" id="pgepubid00504"><a id="page_465" title="{465}"></a></span> Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”</p>

<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.</p>

<p>“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a
special licence—you must and shall be married by a special licence.
But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond
of, that I may have it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.</p>

<p>“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like <i>your</i> husband quite as well
as Jane’s.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{466}" id="pgepubid00505"><a id="page_466" title="{466}"></a></span>”</p>

<img alt="E" src="8773024604044034626_i_495_b.png" id="img_images_i_495_b.png"/></span>LIZABETH’S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{467}"><a id="page_467" title="{467}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I <i>had</i> begun.”</p>

<p>“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour
to <i>you</i> was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”</p>

<p>“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”</p>

<p>“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for <i>your</i> approbation alone. I roused and
interested you, because I was so unlike <i>them</i>. Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me—but nobody thinks
of <i>that</i> when they fall in love.”</p>

<p>“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?”</p>

<p>“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{468}" id="pgepubid00507"><a id="page_468" title="{468}"></a></span> What made you so shy of me, when you
first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”</p>

<p>“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”</p>

<p>“But I was embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“And so was I.”</p>

<p>“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”</p>

<p>“A man who had felt less might.”</p>

<p>“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
<i>would</i> have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you <i>would</i> have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. <i>Too
much</i>, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject? This will never do.”</p>

<p>“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,
and I was determined at once to know everything.”</p>

<p>“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{469}" id="pgepubid00508"><a id="page_469" title="{469}"></a></span>”</p>

<p>“My real purpose was to see <i>you</i>, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and
if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”</p>

<p>“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?”</p>

<p>“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to
be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly.”</p>

<p>“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”</p>

<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s
long letter; but now, having <i>that</i> to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:—</p>

<p>“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But <i>now</i> suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to
the Lakes. How could I be so<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{470}" id="pgepubid00509"><a id="page_470" title="{470}"></a></span> silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours,” etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return
for his last.</p>
